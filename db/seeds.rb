# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
List.create(title:"Carry On", excerpt:"Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin'at us no stopping
Always Carry On")
List.create(title:"Black Wind, Fire and Steel", excerpt:"Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near
